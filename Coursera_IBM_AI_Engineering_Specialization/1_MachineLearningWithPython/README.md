## Regression
- The process of predict a continuous value.

**X**: independent / exploratory variable

**Y**: dependent / target variable

Simple Regression can be linear or non-linear: It is used to predict Y over X. 

Multiple Regression can also be linear or non-linear: Is used to predict Y over X1, X2, Xn.


Pros of Linear Regression:
- Very fast method;
- Not capable of tuning the parameters;
- Highly interpretable.

**RSE**: Relative Square Error


## Logistic Regression
- Classification algorithm for categorical variables.
- Can be used for both binary and multi-class classification.

It is suitable ...
- If data is binary;
- If we need probabilistic results;
- When we need a linear decision boundary;
- IF we need to understand the impact of a feature.


## Gradient Descent
- It is a technique to use the derivative of a cost function to change the parameter values, in order to minimize the cost.
