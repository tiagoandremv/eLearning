Regression
- The process of predict a continuous value.

X: independent / exploratory variable
Y: dependent / target variable

Simple Regression can be linear or non-linear: It is used to predict Y over X. 

Multiple Regression can also be linear or non-linear: Is used to predict Y over X1, X2, Xn.


Pros of Linear Regression:
- Very fast method;
- Not capable of tuning the parameters;
- Highly interpretable.

RSE: Relative Square Error
